# Contributing to `stella`

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with GitHub

I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

## Use GitHub Flow

All code changes happen through Pull Requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase
(I use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)).
I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed behavior, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the tests pass (locally and in GitHub).
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Open a pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood
to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers/me if that's a
concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub Issues

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/very-doge-wow/stella/issues/new/choose).
It's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background, explain the context
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide sample code.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff
  you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Try using the same coding style as other code in the repository. You can try
running a linter for style clarification. However, keep in mind that we
do not want to `die in beauty` - function over form.

## Use Conventional Commits

Commits should follow the pattern as specified
[here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
